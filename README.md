MaxHeap algorithm

Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a Max Heap data structure in Java, created for the "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course.

The project includes:

Core MaxHeap class
Performance tracking (comparisons, swaps, array accesses)
Unit tests with JUnit 5
CLI interface


Features:

Insert elements
Build heap from an array
Merge two heaps
Metrics collection (comparisons, swaps, recursive calls, array accesses, memory allocations)


Comprehensive unit tests covering:
Empty heap
Single element
Duplicates
Build heap from array
Increase-key and extract-max operations
